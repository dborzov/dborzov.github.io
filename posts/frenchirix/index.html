    <h1 id="frenchirix-and-the-research-on-how-to-learn-languages"><strong>Frenchirix and the Research on How to Learn Languages</strong></h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a little side project I call <a href="https://frenchirix.borzov.ca/">Frenchirix</a> in my spare time. The name is a spoof of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix">Asterix</a> (or if you are their copyright lawyer, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vercingetorix">ancient Gallic names</a> <a href="#footnotes">[6]</a>).</p>
<p>In short, it&rsquo;s a little website I built to help my kids practice French with dialogue from a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81316606">French cartoon TV show they like</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to share a bit about what I&rsquo;m trying to do with it.</p>
<p>It started with me wanting to help my kids with French at school.</p>
<p>After some trial and error, we found this &ldquo;one weird trick&rdquo; that worked better than anything else. And it wasn&rsquo;t Duolingo.</p>
<p>The trick is <strong>regular exposure to enjoyable French video content that the kids choose themselves</strong>. It can be as little as 10-15 minutes a day; what matters is that it&rsquo;s regular (ideally, daily) and part of their routine.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only part of it. It also needs to be complemented with <strong>spaced repetition</strong>: revisiting the same content, the same dialogue, and vocabulary every couple of days for some time.</p>
<p>This tool is designed to make this second part go a bit smoother: it makes it easier to re-expose kids to French dialogue that&rsquo;s meaningful to them.</p>
<h3 id="the-science-of-what-works-for-language-learning"><strong>The Science of What Works for Language Learning</strong></h3>
<p>I wanted the tool&rsquo;s design to be guided by established findings in the science and research fields of language learning <a href="#references">[1-5]</a>.</p>
<p>I asked around and got in touch with people with university degrees in pertinent fields: linguistics, education, and second language acquisition. I asked those folks for recommendations for the best sources I could use to learn where these fields are at.</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="#references">list of references I got at the end of this post</a>.</p>
<p>I learned that a fair share of what these books talk about is how their academic competitors got it wrong, and all that stuff about different &ldquo;schools of thought&rdquo; on the subject. The stuff that&rsquo;s clearly important to them, but we don&rsquo;t particularly care about for our purposes.</p>
<p>So if you are curious, here&rsquo;s an actionable summary of <strong>what works</strong>, based on my understanding of what most of these sources and &ldquo;schools of thought&rdquo; agree upon, with all that other drama and fancy words filtered out:</p>
<h4 id="1-hardware-accelerated-subconscious-learning">1. Hardware-Accelerated Subconscious Learning</h4>
<p>A computer person might say that the skill of communication is &ldquo;hardware-accelerated&rdquo; in our brains. It&rsquo;s like a GPU in a computer that can only do one thing: graphics, but it does it very well <a href="#footnotes">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>The only language learning method that works is one that taps into this.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of that? For one thing, true language acquisition is completely subconscious process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s akin to learning to ride a bike. It&rsquo;s about giving your subconscious the time and opportunity to figure things out. Your part is to just keep trying and &ldquo;getting on the bike&rdquo; and other than that, get out of the way and trust the process.</p>
<p>Consciously studying <em>about</em> the language (grammar, phonetics) helps about as much as physics lectures help you ride a bike.</p>
<p>That is, not that much, especially for kids and beginners <a href="#references">[2, 3, 5]</a>.</p>
<h4 id="2-comprehensible-input-first">2. Comprehensible Input First</h4>
<p>I think this particular point was the most counter-intuitive and surprising.</p>
<p>Brain studies suggest there is fundamentally only one way we acquire language: by practicing understanding of the &ldquo;<strong>input</strong>&rdquo;: reading and listening.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it looks like producing language <strong>output</strong> —speaking and writing— are not separate skills, but are actually to a large degree powered by the  skill of <strong>input</strong> comprehension as well.</p>
<p>If language acquisition were a house, understanding input is building the foundation, and the ability to generate output is putting up the roof.</p>
<p>That means that spending too much time on output before input comprehension is on sufficiently solid ground is overrated.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this is that it&rsquo;s a good idea to hold off on constantly testing and evaluating how well a kid is doing. Soft and squishy biological things like our brains do not have progress bars that need to go to 100%.</p>
<p>One manifestation of this dynamic is that when babies learn their first language, they have a long &ldquo;silent period&rdquo; where they understand a great deal but speak very little [2].</p>
<p>This counter-intuitive point is somewhat hard to apply in practice for social reasons: when a person is watching cartoons, for example, and not being barraged with output exercises all the time, <strong>it just doesn&rsquo;t LOOK like she&rsquo;s learning</strong>.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just not suffering enough.</p>
<h4 id="3-misleading-context">3. Misleading Context</h4>
<p>Understanding other people is an instinct at the core of being human. Harnessing this superpower is the only path to acquiring another language.</p>
<p>Yet, the important distinction is that the instinct is for <strong>using language to UNDERSTAND PEOPLE</strong>, not to do well on conjugation quizzes.</p>
<p>This is not how a second language is often used in a school classroom context, for example, where it&rsquo;s not a tool to communicate but rather a peculiar activity one is expected to do to please the adults.</p>
<p>To drive this point home, the second the teacher needs to say something truly important, she&rsquo;ll switch to English [1,4].</p>
<h4 id="4-understanding-is-the-reward">4. Understanding is the Reward</h4>
<p>Our innate language learning ability is powerful and can overcome significant hurdles, but only if it&rsquo;s used as a means to get to what&rsquo;s catnip to our brains: the reward of understanding a <strong>meaningful and intriguing message</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s spin up Duolingo or walk into a school French class.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Hier il pleuvait, mais aujourd&rsquo;hui il fait beau&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>- Oh, so that means it was raining? Where was it raining?</p>
<p>- Nowhere in particular, it&rsquo;s just an example.</p>
<p>- So it&rsquo;s make-believe, or a lie?</p>
<p>- No, it&rsquo;s much, much less than that.</p>
<p>When we work with sentence examples where the point is to translate them into English, the meaning becomes irrelevant. It&rsquo;s no longer about understanding a message that relates to the world around us, it turns into this bizarre puzzle of translating one sequence of symbols into another.</p>
<p>Kids are wired to be great at mapping words into meaning. Doing puzzles where you map words to some other words is not that:</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:1313/img/rain.png" alt="Img"></p>
<p>Imagine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">Professor Pavlov</a> putting his mind to devise another cruel experiment: conditioning his poor dogs to become bored and zone out at the first sounds of French. How would he do it?</p>
<p>He would flood them with sentences that mean nothing.</p>
<h4 id="5-exposure-to-authentic-language">5. Exposure to Authentic Language</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s often pointed out that naturally spoken French is so different from &ldquo;textbook French&rdquo; that it&rsquo;s reasonable to treat them as two separate languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spoken French</strong>. The language millions of people use to communicate.</li>
<li><strong>Textbook French</strong>. A dead language for books and exercises. Like Latin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which one&rsquo;s worth it? The answer is obvious.</p>
<p>And yes, if you just take any random utterance from the street said by one native to another in their natural habitat of, say, France or Quebec, it won&rsquo;t be good learning material.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s true for any language.</p>
<p>Language used in kids&rsquo; TV shows is one example of great learning material to practice the &ldquo;spoken language French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When kids&rsquo; TV shows are produced, millions of dollars are at stake. Hundreds of people work on a show for years. People&rsquo;s careers and mortgages are on the line.</p>
<p>You can be sure they&rsquo;ve made certain the show is understandable to French-speaking children of various ages and levels of language mastery.</p>
<p>Why not use those?</p>
<p>But since everyone&rsquo;s teaching textbook French first, it cannot be that one-sided, right? What are the arguments in favour of doing things right and starting with &ldquo;textbook French&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Many of these arguments resemble those in favour of teaching Latin. We&rsquo;re told that this is the only &ldquo;true&rdquo; version. We get to hear arguments involving people who died a long time ago. We are told that it&rsquo;s how things have always been done. We hear that the &ldquo;ne&rdquo; in &ldquo;Je ne sais pas&rdquo; is important because it comes from Latin negation, so it must live there forever. We are told that those who mumble &ldquo;Schpaah&rdquo; instead are despicable, uncultured low-lives who are wrong in their ways.</p>
<p>If you cast all this garbage aside, the only potentially solid argument is that &ldquo;spoken French,&rdquo; like any oral language, doesn&rsquo;t have a writing system that fits its needs.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be honest, no form of French does.</p>
<h4 id="6-winging-it-is-part-of-the-process">6. Winging It Is Part of the Process</h4>
<p>In traditional language classes, there&rsquo;s a focus on catching a student who hasn&rsquo;t really understood every part of the language input. The student must be called out and face consequences for this &ldquo;crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turns out that not understanding everything—and not obsessing over it—is an integral part of how our brains work.</p>
<p>We do this all the time, and, for one more reason to leave the learner alone, we do it mostly unconsciously [1,2].</p>
<h1 id="frenchirix"><strong>Frenchirix</strong></h1>
<p>This background informs what I am trying to make with Frenchirix:</p>
<h4 id="1-design-based-on-science">1. Design based on science</h4>
<p>First and foremost, the idea is to design for what we know to actually work for language learning, not something that&rsquo;s there just because it meets people&rsquo;s expectations of what language learning should look like.</p>
<p>In particular, I want to try come up with things that the science points at as good ideas, but other educational resources do not do.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>Not to waste time with spelling and all that grammar stuff is the most obvious thing, but it&rsquo;s kinda obvious anyway.</p>
<p>What else then? Right now, the best I was able to come up with are the mini-games you see on the website, but I am not particularly happy with them either. I think that we can find better ideas if we think about it carefully enugh. I just don&rsquo;t see them yet.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions? Please let me know.</p>
<h4 id="2-design-driven-by-feedback">2. Design driven by feedback</h4>
<p>I am building this first and foremost for my kids.</p>
<p>The design is driven by the feedback I get from them using the app.</p>
<p>Numerous times now, I had the expereince of something in Frenchirix turning out working in a completely different way than I expected.</p>
<h4 id="3-practicing-comprehensible-input">3. Practicing Comprehensible Input</h4>
<p>The app is specifically focused on helping kids practice understanding audio input of native French media content.</p>
<p>Just making a tool that helps with this particular thing and does it well and properly would be awesome.</p>
<p>I will try not to get distracted by other things, no matter how shiny.</p>
<h4 id="5-spaced-repetition">5. Spaced Repetition</h4>
<p>The point is to use the power of spaced repetition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what gamification mechanic I added is trying to do: to encourage daily practice.</p>
<p>The goal is to get the kids to spend three to five minutes working through the same dialogue on four or five occasions, spaced two to three days apart.</p>
<h4 id="6-anchor-to-meaning-not-other-words">6. Anchor to Meaning, Not Other Words</h4>
<p>Using French versions of shows your child already loves in English is our golden ticket.</p>
<p>To the kid, that means the dialogue is no longer a bunch of foreign words slapped together: words carry a story she&rsquo;s immersed in, the jokes, the emotions that  the characters experience.</p>
<p>The French dialogue they see in the app is soaked in this context that already lives in their brains.</p>
<h4 id="7-avoid-getting-stuck">7. Avoid Getting Stuck</h4>
<p>In the mini-game design, it&rsquo;s important to avoid situations where a kid gets stuck and frustrated.</p>
<p>For example, in a mini-game where words from a scene must be matched to their translations, the full dialogue is also presented on the same page. So the word translations (the answer keys, if you will) can be viewed in the given context with only a few taps.</p>
<p>That means that any mini-game can be solved easily without prior knowledge of the relevant French; it will only take a little bit longer.</p>
<p>The point is to re-expose the child to meaningful French, not to test them.</p>
<h4 id="7-avoid-getting-stuck-1">7. Avoid Getting Stuck</h4>
<p>There you have it, the thinking behind this little side project of mine called Frenchirix. Maybe you can try it and maybe your kids will find it useful too.</p>

<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
<ol start="6">
<li>Since some people were wondering: yes, the website currently uses some dialogue lines from a Netflix TV show as language examples for educational purposes. As a non-commercial educational website, this use fully meets the conditions of the &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; doctrine in the US and &ldquo;fair dealing&rdquo; in Canada. Still, we all know that this has never stopped some of those companies with lawyers that need to find ways to justify their salaries. Therefore, the idea is to focus on building the data processing pipeline that will work for any media, not just the specific one currently used. This way, the second that specific copyright owners express disagreement with this particular use, the public version of this website will switch to something else.</li>
<li>And like with GPUs, things are actually much more complicated, and I do not claim to understand all this all that much. But I have gotta say that this is an oversimplification to get a point across.</li>
