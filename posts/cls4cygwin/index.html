<h2 id="enabling-iterm-s-cmd-k-hotkey-for-cygwin-shell-with-conemu">Enabling iTerm&rsquo;s <code>Cmd+K</code> hotkey for Cygwin shell with ConEmu</h2>

<p>Sometimes I have to use the shell (a command-line interface) on Windows and that sucks.</p>

<p>Since Windows ecosystem (including shells, <code>Powershell</code> and <code>cmd</code>) has been historically quite removed from POSIX/UNIX patterns we came to know and love, even performing basic tasks gets challenging for me.</p>

<p>Fornunatelly, there is <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin">Cygwin</a>, an open-source project that wraps the Windows system calls and makes an imitation of a bash shell we came to know and love. It is pretty decent for most every day uses.</p>

<p>A decent terminal emulator application helps too. I use and recommend <a href="https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu">ConEmu</a>.</p>

<p>One thing I missed from iTerm2 is to be able to clear the session screen completely with &ldquo;Cmd+K&rdquo; hotkey. Here is how to reproduce the same functionality for Windows/ConEmu/Cygwin.</p>

<p>There is a key difference between Unix and Windows shells: in Unix, keeping track of the buffer content is the responsibility of the terminal emulator (iTerm2, for example), however in Windows it is a part of the shell&rsquo;s session. As a result, clearing the buffer can be done with a shell command, <code>cls</code> in their case.</p>

<p>Since Cygwin is still a Windows shell, clearing screen is a shell command as well, which is invoked with an escape code. Here it is: <code>echo -e '\0033\0143'</code>.</p>

<p>Here is how to set up the hotkey binding with Conemu to achive the Cmd+K behaviour of iTerm2:</p>
