    <p>Sometimes I have to use a shell (a command-line interface) on Windows and overall it is pretty challenging for me.
Windows is fundamentally different from the Unix/POSIX conventions I got used to when working with Linux and MacOSX and the native shells  for Windows (cmd/Powershell) are quite different.</p>

<p>Fornunatelly, there is Cygwin, an open-source project that wraps the Windows functioanllity and makes some imitation of a bash we came to know and love that offers something similar to <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin">bash</a>. It is pretty decent for most every day uses and I like it a lot.</p>

<p>One thing that helps is a decent Terminal application (the thing that provides GUI for the cli session). <a href="https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu">ConEmu</a> is pretty great, highly customizable and has all the basic features.</p>

<p>One thing I missed from iTerm2 is to be able to clear the session screen completely with &ldquo;Cmd+K&rdquo; letters. I got investigating and I am happy to report that I found the solution.</p>

<p>It turns out that there is another key difference between Unix and Windows shells: in Unix, keeping track of printed content is the responsibility of the terminal application, but for Windows it is a part of the shell&rsquo;s session. As a result, clearing the screen can be done with a shell command, <code>cls</code> in their case.</p>

<p>So since Cygwin is still a Windows shell, clearing screen is a shell command as well, which is invoked with an escape code. Here it is: <code>echo -e '\0033\0143'</code>.</p>

<p>Here is how to set it up:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s set up ConEmu&rsquo;s hot key to use the command. Open up the ConEmu settings (right click on the button)</p>
