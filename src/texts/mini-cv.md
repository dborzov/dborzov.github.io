Description: My contribution to this team project was the development of a web-based CMS system. I
worked on the backend development in Python/Django with SQL-based database binding.
github.com/dborzov/machine_learning_algorithms
An open source software library I developed that implements several statistics/machine learning
algorithms (based on the book "Learning from Data" by Abu-Mostafa et al.)
dborzov.github.io/fredholm/
An open-source library for solving Fredholm equations of a certain type numerically. Applications include
research in applied mathematics and theoretical physics.
github.com/dborzov/subtitles2flashcards
A nice little open-source program that allows for analysis of word frequencies in movie subtitles.
